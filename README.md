# Quiz_Game
A simple Quiz Game with Timer made in python using Tkinter.
A Quiz game is an interface which provides oppurtunity to the user to test their current knowledge and skills and improve on the same.

This project provided me practical knowledge of Python programming and a glimpse to handle real-life oriented projects.


****************************************{{{{PYTHON PROJECT BASIC INSTRUCTIONS}}}}*****************************************


1.First everyone should have IDLE or any compiler (like VS Code) downloaded on their computer if not:
		
Just click on this link and click download : https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. After IDLE check for tkinter module by following these steps:

For Tkinter type the following command in the shell  (>>>):
>>>import tkinter
>>>tkinter._test()

If a window opens then its done...

3.Now make a folder on your desktop and download the files present here there.
The lines where the PATH is mentioned should be accordingly altered.

4.Now do all the coding on the downloaded file only and run it on your IDLE.

5.After doing your part save it and proceed with the next part if any.

6.After completing your part on the downloaded file just copy your part of source code and
paste it on the main file in onedrive after commenting your name and part of the prog.(eg. -->  #PARTH general qs)

7.Open the Editor mode in IDLE and not ".py" and save the file in ".json" format to make it work.
(For Example :- The file named "data" should be saved as "data.json" not "data.py").

8.The questions list are already provided as three text files for three categories : "GENERAL" , "SPORTS" & "SCIENCE".

9.The questions can be changed by taking values from the text files and altering the ".json" file.

10.Also the time in seconds can be changed by putting a different value in countdown() function.
